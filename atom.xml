    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My octopress blog works now, but it wasn&rsquo;t working for a while. I&rsquo;ve overheard from some of my classmates at Flatiron that they are experiencing this as well. Below &ndash; a short and sweet post about how I figured out what was wrong and how to fix it.</p>

<p>On July 11, I tried to post a blog post and got an epic error when I tried to rake deploy. I wish I had it copied here somewhere but I am pretty sure I closed all terminal windows that had that error by now. I&rsquo;ve heard about logs, but I&rsquo;m not sure where these live so this will have to be a work of imagination on your part. It was a very long paragraph with many regular expression slashes that ended by saying &ldquo;regexp error&rdquo;. Definitely a little scary; I find those regular expression slashes a bit aggressive myself. Furthermore, there was no documenation or discussion online with this particular error, so that was weird.</p>

<p>Interestingly, when I was presenting the blog post for July 11, my classmate Max (maxjacobson.github.io) was able to find my post through this link (<a href="https://github.com/ruthienachmany/ruthienachmany.github.io/blob/a401e7128313b5176b361ae67003ec935d8b05f6/source/_posts/2013-07-10-preparing-for-my-first-tech-talk.markdown">https://github.com/ruthienachmany/ruthienachmany.github.io/blob/a401e7128313b5176b361ae67003ec935d8b05f6/source/_posts/2013-07-10-preparing-for-my-first-tech-talk.markdown</a>) &ndash; or in other words, it was on my repo, but did not reploy correctly to my octopress site.</p>

<p>Then I avoided the problem for a while.</p>

<p>Then I was like, hm, I feel like expressing myself again, so I tried to write another blog post, hoping the error forgot about itself. No such luck. I sat with my TA Jon (<a href="http://jonathangrover.com">http://jonathangrover.com</a>) and compared our octopresses. The only difference we could discern was that his posts were saved in a branch called &lsquo;gh-pages&rsquo; while mine were in &lsquo;source&rsquo;. We looked into it, but determined that it was not the problem, both because in the octopress documentation, both are presented as approaches for posting blogs, and also because I had previously been able to deploy my posts.</p>

<p>However, as we were speaking, I noticed that we were running different versions of Ruby. Interesting&hellip; I started to think back to July 11. That was the Thursday after the 4th of July weekend. The 4th of July weekend happened when we were just starting to learn Rails &ndash; we had a half hour lecture on Rails, and then were set loose into our vacation to read books/documentation, learn about Rails, and enjoy the 4th. I was super excited, followed by slightly dejected, as I struggled to understand the multiple controllers of Rails (see my Sinatra vs. Rails blog post and presentation for more detailed descriptions of my struggles and process of understanding).</p>

<p>One of the big challenges was that Rails 4 came out right before we started learning Rails. We&rsquo;re focusing on Rails 3 right now in class versus jumping straight into 4, both because the documentation is much richer for Rails 3 right now, because once you learn one version of Rails I think it is much easier to jump into the next, and because Avi said so (for good reason &ndash; it&rsquo;s better to let someone else catch the bugs).</p>

<p>Despite all this, I naturally downloaded Rails 4 by mistake, and have been kind of atoning ever since. I&rsquo;ve shambled through RVM, rewriting Gemfiles, and a variety of other potions for trying to make my Rails apps open in 3 vs 4.</p>

<p>My TA Ashley provided a helpful way to specify versions:
rvm use ruby-1.9.3-p429
rvm gemset create rails3.2.13
rvm <a href="&#109;&#97;&#x69;&#108;&#x74;&#111;&#x3a;&#x72;&#117;&#98;&#121;&#x2d;&#49;&#46;&#x39;&#46;&#51;&#x2d;&#x70;&#x34;&#50;&#x39;&#64;&#x72;&#x61;&#105;&#108;&#x73;&#x33;&#x2e;&#50;&#x2e;&#x31;&#51;">&#x72;&#x75;&#98;&#121;&#45;&#49;&#46;&#57;&#x2e;&#51;&#45;&#112;&#x34;&#50;&#57;&#64;&#x72;&#97;&#x69;&#108;&#x73;&#x33;&#46;&#50;&#46;&#x31;&#x33;</a>
gem install rails &mdash;version=3.2.13</p>

<p>But I kind of prefer my classmate Kirin&rsquo;s (<a href="http://kirinm1.github.io/">http://kirinm1.github.io/</a>) approach, just for its simplicity:
rails <em>3.2.13</em> new</p>

<p>Anyways, reflecting upon all this, I realized that I may have changed the version of Ruby I was running by mistake, and perhaps this was affecting my octopress malfunction.</p>

<p>I changed my version of Ruby back to 1.9.3 &ndash; and alas, it still didn&rsquo;t work. Frustrated, I shut down my terminal and left octopress alone for a day.</p>

<p>Sometimes when you give someone a day to calm down, they become more reasonable, personable, and polite when you see them again, or take them to meet people. I was trying to show my friend Chris Lake (chhhris.github.io) my awful regular expression error yesterday. As I was demonstrating it, octopress asked me to bundle update RedCloth (<a href="https://github.com/jgarber/redcloth">https://github.com/jgarber/redcloth</a>), which is part of the Gemfile.</p>

<p>From the gem&rsquo;s site:
&ldquo;RedCloth is a module for using the Textile markup language in Ruby. Textile is a simple text format that can be converted to html, eliminating the need to use html directly to create documents, blogs, or web pages. Textile gives you readable text while you’re writing and beautiful text for your readers. If you need to break out into html, Textile allows you to do so easily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As perhaps you can anticipate by fact of reading this post, my blog now works.</p>

<p>Lessons learned:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Installing Rails 4 (and trying to drop down) may be giving you problems with your octopress &ndash; if experiencing issues, explore which version of Ruby you are running.</p></li>
<li><p>Get intimate with RVM. Understanding how this works will save you errors with lots of slashes in the future.</p></li>
<li><p>Share your errors with your peers. Sometimes they will help you, either by identifying what the error is not (e.g. Max helped me understand that it was NOT a problem with uploading to my repo; John helped me understand that it was NOT an error with my branch and the conventions of Octopress). Sometimes they will help you by identifying what the error is. Other times, it is just kind of like the experience of calling your dad over and showing him a problem with the sink or circuitbreaker or your phone &ndash; as soon as you call him over, the problem goes away. Persistence is key!</p></li>
</ol>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[So Many Resources...]]></title>
    <link href="http://ruthienachmany.github.io/blog/2013/07/23/somanyresources/"/>
    <updated>2013-07-23T17:26:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://ruthienachmany.github.io/blog/2013/07/23/somanyresources</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m starting to feel both excited and overwhelmed by how many resources there are for Ruby and Rails online, especially now that I&rsquo;m at a point where I have built up a base so that I can really start to take advantage of them.</p>

<p>Types of resources:</p>

<p>BLOG POSTS
There are a lot of blog posts out there that a beginner can take advantage of. For me, though I&rsquo;ve been on and off blogging for basically my entire sentient life, it&rsquo;s new and different to read technical blogs. I find them useful both for trying to solve my problems, and for trying to become a better code communicator and storyteller. On Tuesday, Peter Cooper from Ruby Weekly spoke to our Flatiron School class via Skype. I really enjoyed hearing about his background, his approach, and how his role in the community has evolved. It made me feel inspired to try my own hand at email newsletters &ndash; never thought I&rsquo;d say that!</p>

<p>One of the things that stuck with me from Peter&rsquo;s presentation was what he said about how to tell a good story or teach someone about code. He said that he has an ability to always remember what it was like to be a beginner, and leverages that mindset in order to most effectively teach people about code. Between that comment, and reading the thought-provoking blog posts of my peers at Flatiron and of the Ruby community in general, I am trying to become more comfortable with blogging about code as a beginner. Sometimes I think that perhaps my realizations are so minute that they might be irrelevant to others &ndash; &ldquo;oh, I need to bundle update&rdquo; or &ldquo;I just needed to drop the database&rdquo; or &ldquo;so THAT&rsquo;S how application.yml works.&rdquo; At the same time, I know that whenever I find posts or discussions that help me quickly resolve a problem that was leading me down an unnecessary rabbit hole, I feel so thankful.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t often go on Hacker News, but when I do I usually find some really cool stuff, so maybe I should start going on more&hellip; Yesterday I found this blog which really inspired me:
<a href="http://blog.jenniferdewalt.com/post/56319597560/im-learning-to-code-by-building-180-websites-in-180">http://blog.jenniferdewalt.com/post/56319597560/im-learning-to-code-by-building-180-websites-in-180</a>
Jennifer DeWalt is teaching herself to code to building 180 websites in 180 days, starting from a place of no experience. I so admire both the learning approach, what she&rsquo;s actually been able to make, and her openness to exposing her learning in this way. If you go back to her first posts (<a href="http://blog.jenniferdewalt.com/page/15">http://blog.jenniferdewalt.com/page/15</a>), she is able to write about her learning as a beginner in a concise, technical, and elegant way. Goals!</p>

<p>So there are a lot of blog posts out there to read, to find when I search for answers to my questions, and to try to emulate as I become a better communicator of my code &lsquo;journey&rsquo;.</p>

<p>RAILSCASTS
Omg Railscasts. I&rsquo;m pretty sure this was the reaction of me and all my classmates when we first started listening to them. Sometimes when you&rsquo;re starting out, you&rsquo;re not quite sure how to begin your learning and identifying topics to investigate. Ryan Bates knows. And he explains them so well. At first I was listening to them while working out (the app is awesome, thank you to whoever made it!) or on the go, but I&rsquo;ve more recently started to code along with them. Each approach provides different benefits. It&rsquo;s intellectually fascinating to better understand rails initialization. However, when learning about dynamic forms or omniauth, it might be better to code along. Anyways, Railscasts is an addictively useful and interesting resource &ndash; and this is coming from someone who is really averse to online videos, especially ones on the longer side.</p>

<p>CURATED SOURCES (E.G. RUBY WEEKLY)
I just signed up for Ruby Weekly (and a bunch of other stuff too) after Peter Cooper spoke to our class, but I&rsquo;m excited to get my first batch of newsletters! Again, I expect these to provide more blogs and online resources to help me overcome specific challenges in my programs.</p>

<p>SPEAKERDECKS
I&rsquo;ve written about these in an earlier blog post, but I LOVE speakerdecks. I could watch Zach Holman teach me about Github all day. I find the speakerdeck content as a whole really engaging and high quality. It&rsquo;s another resource you could spend a long time exploring. Additionally, it&rsquo;s another expression of how people think about presenting and teaching others about the programs and apps they are building or what they are learning as a result.</p>

<p>BOOKS
There are so many books. I&rsquo;ve started an ebook folder in my Dropbox which is already burgeoning. I could write a whole post about deciding which book to read, where to start, how to read it, etc. I could code along with a book, and might learn more, but I would read it much slower. I could go for breadth, and try to get the &lsquo;sound&rsquo; of the approach of the author in my head. You just have to start somewhere, but in this field it feels like there is always so much more to learn that figuring out the most efficent use of your time is challenging.</p>

<p>AND THERE&rsquo;S MORE&hellip;
For me, the wealth of resources about Ruby and Rails is both incredibly exciting and a bit of a challenge. I love to understand how things work and how different parts of a system operate in tandem, so I definitely can fall into reading, watching, and learning from these resources in the few hours I have between the end of Flatiron on one day and the start of school on the next. At the same time, I&rsquo;ve seen my understanding solidify markedly over the last week and a half, as we&rsquo;ve moved at Flatiron from lecture/lab mode to the application-building phase. I know that the more code I write, the better I will be. At the same time, reading Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby or watching Railscasts feels like a master class in understanding how to code better and helps close some of the gaps in my understanding. I feel thankful that I&rsquo;ve discovered a field where there is so much to learn all the time. The question now is how best to do that&hellip;</p>

<p>In some way, learning to program reminds me of when the iPhone first came out. My father was the first one in our family with one. At first, it was this surprising new thing, where each time we had a debate or an unanswered question, he would just default to looking up the answer on his iPhone. This is kind of obvious behavior by now, but it was a totally different approach than remembering to look it up when you get home or whatever. In some way, I think these resources present an opportunity to do just that. As I try to build apps and programs, there are answers to my questions and new paths they can lead me down in terms of learning, as long as I figure out how and when to ask.</p>

    <link href="http://ruthienachmany.github.io/blog/2013/07/10/preparing-for-my-first-tech-talk/"/>
    <updated>2013-07-10T20:43:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://ruthienachmany.github.io/blog/2013/07/10/preparing-for-my-first-tech-talk</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m giving my first tech talk tonight, at the NYC on Rails meetup at the Flatiron School. Preparing for this was an exciting and challenging process as a beginner. Some lessons below:</p>

<p>Positioning:
As a beginner, there&rsquo;s a good chance you know less about programming than anyone you&rsquo;re speaking to. In life, I think it&rsquo;s always important to find the place where you come at a situation from a position of advantage instead of limitation. The beginner has the unique perspective of&hellip; a beginner. No one who is not a beginner can access that process of problem-solving in a totally new and unfamiliar field that the beginner can. So the beginner&rsquo;s role is to be as expressive as possible about how they build pathways from one concept to another. Presenting this can be helpful for a more experienced audience in several ways. First, it&rsquo;s a reality check for whether someone listening to the presentation understand the concept well enough to be able to present it to the beginner. Second, when learning a great deal rapidly and working on a range of projects, it is easy to forget some of the initial questions that challenged or drove you at the initial phase. Listening to the beginner might help recall or clarify some early motivation for the audience. In sum, it&rsquo;s important as a beginner to use this position as effectively as possible, both for oneself and for one&rsquo;s audience, as a community-building and self-reflective exercise.</p>

<p>Purpose:
After going in several directions about what I should present, I realized that the most important thing for me right now would be to establish strong fundamentals of understanding of Rails. It&rsquo;s key to think what you want to learn from giving your presentation. Not only is this the most productive use of your time (and as a beginner it seems like there&rsquo;s not enough time to read half the documentation or do half the problems or assignments you want to do), but it also means that you now have a stake in the presentation, which makes it more interesting for your viewers.</p>

<p>Problem-Solving:
After several mistaken paths for this presentation&rsquo;s topic (think: analyzing trends in Ruby gems, trees of New York rails app, interactive Ulysses, etc), I consulted with my father about how to approach this talk. He suggested that I focus on a problem I had and how I worked through it. That&rsquo;s why tonight I&rsquo;m going to speak on conceptualizing Rails after Sinatra. Pinning down one&rsquo;s problem to present is also tough as a beginner. At first, I felt pretty shaky about Rails, and felt a little nervous to present a problem I didn&rsquo;t feel too resolved about. Now I think I understand it a little bit better, but then I ask myself whether it&rsquo;s worth it at all to present about this challenge if everyone else in the room understands Rails pretty well. When learning so much so fast, this is bound to come up. Starting out, you might not want to return so fast to that feeling of not understanding. But being able to pin down this process is useful not only for the talk, but for a resource to draw upon when facing more complex challenges in code in the future.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Beautiful Code for Beginners]]></title>
    <link href="http://ruthienachmany.github.io/blog/2013/07/10/beautiful-code-for-beginners/"/>
    <updated>2013-07-10T20:40:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://ruthienachmany.github.io/blog/2013/07/10/beautiful-code-for-beginners</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last Wednesday, we saw a presentation on beautiful code by Marcel Molina from RubyConf &lsquo;07. It was a very interesting talk, and I was excited to start being exposed to the world of &#8216;beautiful code,&rsquo; which I&rsquo;ve heard a lot about. Yet as we watched it, I found myself asking what the role of &lsquo;beautiful code&rsquo; is for beginners. Why, if at all, is it important to think about? What can we derive from it as fledgling programmers?</p>

<p> Molina began by looking at Greek philosophical and artistic explorations of the concept of beauty. For the Greeks, from art to religious expression, beauty was a matter of proportion. When things were beautiful, they were good and goodness was beauty in action. One can think of Greek temples as a manifestation of this relationship between religion, creative expression, and mathematical proportion.</p>

<p> Molina takes this idea of ratio and proportion to the world of one&rsquo;s code. He discusses three objectives: proportion, integrity, and clarity. Code should not be too much of one of these three traits, but rather should balance between them. Each section should be responsible for and proportional to its role.</p>

<p>This raises interesting conceptual questions about code, and how it fits into a larger expressive tradition. Who is beautiful code for? The programmer? The user? Both? Is this just a mechanism to help the coder feel a more tangible connection to a larger narrative?</p>

<p>Furthermore, as a beginner, I asked myself what this should mean to me, if anything?</p>

<p>First, I think that beginners can and should be driven by the constant strive towards more integral proportion. It seems to me that Molina thinks not that we should not strive to a certain &lsquo;golden ratio,&rsquo; but driven by the concept of ratio in general. As beginners move from single-unit to more complex code, having a sense of what the role of each part should be will create a better and more versatile product.</p>

<p>Second, for beginners, who have been spending most of their lives until now doing things besides coding, thinking about code in these untraditional terms of beauty and goodness can invoke references to other parts of the beginners life, and start to create pathways for leveraging how they have sought to create clarity, proportion, and integrity in those areas to their coding process. Furthermore, it can clarify alternative solutions when one is stuck thinking in a certain way about a problem.</p>

<p>Third, I think we&rsquo;re all taking part in larger projects of structured creative expression as individuals and communities. Being able to link code to this, and this to code, should hopefully be useful on both a conceptual and functional level, helping beginners get to where they want to go in terms of a contributing and learning environment.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Graphical User Interfaces]]></title>
    <link href="http://ruthienachmany.github.io/blog/2013/06/22/reading-well/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-22T17:58:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://ruthienachmany.github.io/blog/2013/06/22/reading-well</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the interesting processes that I&rsquo;ve been undergoing as I learn to code is thinking critically about the graphic user interface. While I always knew about the command line, I never really connected with it on a personal/intimate level (now we super intimate!). I&rsquo;ve been thinking recently about how much the interface we use to connect with our computers shapes the ways we think about them, think through them, and what we think is possible.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always been very interested in language, the gaps between understanding, and the ways that form influences our understanding of function (for example, metaphors as an interface that shapes our understanding). I thought a lot about this when I studied anthropology of law, a life-changing course I took in college that not only taught me a lot about language and the different ways of establishing truth, meaning, fact, etc, but also turned me into a morning person (it was at 8:30am)! Valuable life lessons. There&rsquo;s an interesting anthropologist of metaphor at Johns Hopkins named Emily White, who looks at these questions. She has one essay that looks at the metaphors we use in biology textbooks. For example, when describing sex cells and the egg and sperm, many textbooks use gendered metaphors and images that are biologically inaccurate, but tie into our obvious cultural relationships with these processes. I think it&rsquo;s clear that there can be implications for how people learn biology and think critically about the paradigms of the field and what is possible via the language they understand it in.</p>

<p>Until now, I&rsquo;ve never questioned the GUIs of my computer (and other devices), nor thought about how they might affect me and how I think on these devices. It was interesting to hear my teacher Avi speak recenly about how he thinks via text editor. This question of how you think digitally is one that has been on my mind recently. I was speaking to a friend, and I mentioned that I thought I would never be able to really think on an iPad or other tablet, and need a computer to write, think, and analyze. He said that perhaps this was just because that was the form I was used to thinking on, had learned how to think on, etc. People who have tablets since they are really young have learned to think on them, just as I learned to think on my computer. This was really interesting, and I actually have noticed that I&rsquo;ve been better at thinking on my phone since thi conversation. It made me realize that (at least to an extent), thinking on a device is not limited just to the functionality horizons of the device, but also to the user&rsquo;s history and experience with the tool. Since I&rsquo;ve been learning to program, I&rsquo;m much better at thinking in text editor, instead of in Microsoft Word or a blogging platform.</p>

<p>Another interesting comment Avi made around the same time was in response to a question a student had about how to start writing code. I think many of us feel, at least some of the time, that we understand the concepts we&rsquo;re learning and even the code, but then when we sit down to actally write code and solve a problem, we don&rsquo;t know where to begin. Avi advised us to just start somewhere, and spoke about how when he was writing, he would use the same paragraph as his first paragraph, and then be able to start writing his story without worrying about the first paragraph. By the time he finished the story, he took out the paragraph. However, as he was speaking about this, I was wondering how this may have affected his stories, the themes they circled around, etc. It seems inevitable that they would be somewhat affected, just as when you read something, you start to get the rhythm in your head and reflect it in your writing.</p>

<p>Similarly, visual imagery, sensory experience, and interactive quality of the GUI must affect the ways we think in it.</p>

<p>I found a really interesting blog that asks these kinds of questions called &ldquo;The Graphical User Interface. Time for a Paradigm Shift?&rdquo; You can find it here: <a href="http://sensomatic.net/gui/">http://sensomatic.net/gui/</a> . One of the most interesting parts of this blog is the timestamp &ndash; it was written by Christine Zmoelnig, who did her masters in Hypermedia Studies in London in 2000.</p>

<p>Everything about this is fascinating. First of all, what is &ldquo;hypermedia&rdquo;?</p>

<p>Upon further research, I found that hypermedia is an extension of the concept of hypertext into other forms of media to generate a non-linear medium of information. Hypermedia is different from multimedia, which is more linear. Hypermedia is often used in reference to electronic literature. The term was first used in an article called &ldquo;Complex information processing: a file structure for the complex, the changing and the indeterminate&rdquo; in 1965 by Ted Nelson, whom the internet calls an &ldquo;IT sociolosopher). He coined &#8220;hypertext&rdquo; and &ldquo;hypermedia&rdquo; (as well as &ldquo;transclusion, virtuality, intertwingularity, and teledildonics&rdquo;&hellip;) Interestingly, he called Tim Berners-Lee&rsquo;s creation of the internet as an oversimplification of his ideas: &ldquo;HTML is precisely what we were trying to PREVENT— ever-breaking links, links going outward only, quotes you can&rsquo;t follow to their origins, no version management, no rights management.&rdquo; Nelson was influential force for a lot of thinkers. Douglas Adams, author of Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy, made a documentary in 1990 called Hyperland about &ldquo;hypertext and surrounding technologies&rdquo; (I&rsquo;m quoting from Wikipedia, but I love the idea of surrounding technologies). This movie sounds amazing &ndash; like a combination of &ldquo;Science of Sleep&rdquo; and the Beatles movie &ldquo;The Point!&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a fantasy documentary that begins with Adams asleep by his fireplace with his TV on. He starts dreaming, and finds himself in his dream taking the TV to the garbage dump, where he meets Tom, a &ldquo;software agent&rdquo; (which apparently means a computer program that acts on your behalf). Tom shows him the future of TV: interactive multimedia. This leads them on a journey, which includes interviews with a number of people experimenting with interactive media in 1990. The film ends with a vision of how information might be accessed in 15 years, which for the film is 2005. Upon retrospect, the film is remarkably prescient for a work that came out about a year before the first web browser was released. All this makes sense in some way, as I think hazily back to when I read all five books of &ldquo;Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy,&rdquo; which starts out linear, and by the end becomes very, very non-linear.</p>

<p>All this is a useful framework as I look at Zmoelnig&rsquo;s GUI blog, thinking about her background and approach at the time of writing. Some of her blog post topics include &ldquo;Visions of the new paradigm&rdquo;, &ldquo;History of the GUI&rdquo;, &ldquo;The GUI&rsquo;s Impact on Society&rdquo;, &ldquo;Mac OSX &lsquo;Aqua&rsquo;: A paradigm shift in GUI design?&rdquo;, &ldquo;3-dimensionality as a quality factor for the user?&rdquo;, &ldquo;The new &lsquo;look-again-look&rsquo;&rdquo;, &ldquo;&lsquo;Alternative Models&rsquo; Time for a different approach to GUI design&rdquo;, and &ldquo;A new medium for GUIs: the Internet&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a very inspired, idealistic, and flexible vision of the GUI. In some way, I think that perhaps because there was so much change happening in that space at the time she was writing (not that there isn&rsquo;t change today, but we have a lot more history/heft to go with it) that she was able to think in this flexible way, and ask questions I haven&rsquo;t seen asked explicitly in many other places about the GUI. On one hand, UX/UI and interaction design are really important spaces for innovation at the moment. However, at least in what I&rsquo;ve come across, they start from level 2, with assumptions taken for granted about the GUI already embedded within them, versus asking those questions and exploring those pillars explicitly. Many of the search results I found when searching &ldquo;alternative GUIs&rdquo; are older pages, or about GUIs for very specific components of an operating system, which may strengthen this point. Furthermore, there&rsquo;s the question of how alternative an alternative GUI would be. There&rsquo;s the level of changing colors, shapes, etc (i.e themes), and then there&rsquo;s the level of changing the associative nature of our computers. Zmoelnig presents one of the few search results I found that explores the latter. She looks at approaches to changing the human-computer interaction via 3d, virtual reality, natural language processing, and the ways that the internet presents some new ways of thinking about these questions.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to look at her description of the internet. She talks about the internet and time: &ldquo;the internet also brought a dynamic dimension into interface design: Time-related navigation concepts like back-buttons and chronological file-structures have only come up with the internet.&rdquo; This is interesting for me to read &ndash; I&rsquo;ve never thought about the internet as explicit chronology before, and this also makes me think about other spatial and temporal relationships the internet does, does not, and could potentially set up. It&rsquo;s also interesting to think how this has changed since 2000.</p>

<p>She also talks about the desktop, which is another thing I never thought critically about until I read her work. The metaphor of the desktop as our homebase for computing via the GUI is interesting, as it references a working site very different from the main one we use today. The spaces and forms we work in are also constantly evolving. Going back to metaphor, language, and description, it&rsquo;s interesting how ideas from one era bleed into and shape our conceptualization of the next.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of interesting stuff going on in her work. As I read through it, I observed a few interesting things. When I started reading Zmoelnig&rsquo;s site, I thought of it as a blog. As I continued to explore the differnet links and refernces, I started to realize that it was actually her dissertation in hypermedia. In some way, the framework of hypermedia that I sought to understand in order to contextualize her thinking led me identify her work as such. Hypermedia shaped my exploration of the concepts she presents, and it shaped my research of the hypermedia about hypermedia. The process of this research is an interesting framework in itself.</p>

<p>Secondly, this exploration opened up my eyes to a few different interfaces I have always taken for granted in my computing history, from the desktop to internet chronology (i.e. the back button).</p>

<p>This all stemmed from what has been happening as I learn to code from the command line, and how that has been changing the way I think about computing, and about breaking down processes more generally. Command line coding is both extremely hypermedia and totally singular in its point of origin. I&rsquo;m not sure what all this means yet (or ever, probably) but I do think it&rsquo;s important to understand the implications of both what we code and the places we code in. By making these explicit, it enables us to better understand about how our thinking occurs within them. From there, we can take understandings from different fields and apply them to our limitations within the medium. So, in sum &ndash; code as collage!</p>

    <link href="http://ruthienachmany.github.io/blog/2013/06/22/dd/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-22T16:20:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://ruthienachmany.github.io/blog/2013/06/22/dd</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>File structures are definitely an art. A file structure has to advocate for both its application and its users. With open source, and the internet more generally, so much of it is connecting with people you may never meet and their creative generations. It&rsquo;s a major communications challenge. I think this is part of why Ruby is so expressive &ndash; and so focused on being ever more expressive, and so common in open source (and so integral to sites that enable open source like Github) as a result.</p>

<p>As a total ruby n00b, I&rsquo;m never quite sure whether it&rsquo;s me or the file structure when I&rsquo;m confused about what to do with a repo, app, etc. I&rsquo;ve found READMEs critically important to help me conceptualize &lsquo;what do I do with this thing &ndash; and where/how can I run it to figure that out.&rsquo; I found Zach Holman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bubs&rdquo; a paradigm of productive simplicity in this regard. Obviously, it&rsquo;s not the most complex and layered app in the world, but it&rsquo;s a gem that allows your command line text to appear in bubbles. Fun and games! I was pretty excited. Not only is it easy to figure out and use right away, but also structurally it&rsquo;s quite easy to read the instructions for how to do this. The more I learn, the more I realize that so much of coding is learning to read code and documentation really well, so it&rsquo;s valuable when a creator helps you do that. There are two folders in this file structure, a &lsquo;bin&rsquo; and a &lsquo;lib&rsquo;. There are five documents, &lsquo;.gitignore&rsquo;, &lsquo;LICENSE.md&rsquo;, &lsquo;README.md&rsquo;, &lsquo;Rakefile&rsquo;, and &lsquo;bubs.gemspec.&rsquo; One thing I found interesting is that only the latter five documents were created by Holman. The &lsquo;bin&rsquo; and the &lsquo;lib&rsquo; were created by open source contributors. Perhaps as a result, it&rsquo;s harder for me to understand specifically what they&rsquo;re doing in those structures, though the meta-text explaining the objective of the folder aids somewhat. This helps me realize that it&rsquo;s important to set your file structure down clearly before open sourcing, because otherwise you run the risk of letting other people make your code messier. It&rsquo;s kind of like database design, in the sense that you need to design for the future, and anticipate use cases differently from the ones you are currently using to problem solve. As a beginner, I think it also has to do with having a very clear sense of what the purpose of each element is, and where it should live as a result.</p>

<p>For file structure dessert, a quote from Ted Nelson, definitely a founding father of the internet, from the article in which he coined the term &ldquo;hypertext&rdquo;:</p>

<p>&ldquo;THE KINDS OF FILE structures required if we are to use the computer for personal files and as an adjunct to creativity are wholly different in character from those customary in business and scientific data processing. They need to provide the capacity for intricate and idiosyncratic arrangements, total modifiability, undecided alternatives, and thorough internal documentation. I want to explain how some ideas developed and what they are. The original problem was to specify a computer system for personal information retrieval and documentation, able to do some rather complicated things in clear and simple ways. In this paper I will explain the original problem. Then I will explain why the problem is not simple, and why the solution (a file structure) must yet be very simple. The file structure suggested here is the Evolutionary List File, to be built of zippered lists. A number of uses will be suggested for such a file, to show the breadth of its potential usefulness. Finally, I want to explain the philosophical implications of this approach for information retrieval and data structure in a changing world.&rdquo;</p>

    <link href="http://ruthienachmany.github.io/blog/2013/06/17/side-projects/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-17T21:17:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://ruthienachmany.github.io/blog/2013/06/17/side-projects</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Side project number one is Citibike.</p>

<p>There are about 20 repos on Github that have to do with Citibike in some way (that I could find at least). Many of them use JSON and/or Python. Since I&rsquo;m still just starting to grasp Ruby, I decided to focus on mainly using the repos that use Ruby. I think the others can provide useful datasets and interesting outcomes I can learn from, but I don&rsquo;t think it would make sense to try to understand Python (apart from my new habit of tech talks with my 17 year old brother, who taught himself Python last summer and learned Java this year in school &ndash; and come to think of it, my new party conversation topics, which based on this weekend, focus on asking my programmer friends and what languages they use).</p>

<p>To use the Ruby repos I have to learn several other things. One repo I found is &ldquo;<a href="https://github.com/strcrzy/citibike.git">https://github.com/strcrzy/citibike.git</a>&rdquo;, which is &ldquo;a collection of ruby scripts that help scrape, slice, and dice the data available from the CitiBike API.&rdquo; To use it I need to use Mongoid, the Ruby ODM framework for MongoDB. It might not be the best strategy to use a repo that requires me to learn Mongo to understand what&rsquo;s going on on the inside, but we have Emily Stoflo, a Columbia professor and software engineer at 10gen, coming in to speak to us today in class, so it won&rsquo;t be a total waste of time.</p>

<p>This all reminds me of some cool things that have been happening as I learn to program. I keep remembering all these other things that I&rsquo;ve heard of in the past that now I start to wonder what they really mean, and start to be able to contextualize that in a larger picture. I think that&rsquo;s part of the reason why I&rsquo;ve been so excited to talk about coding at parties (i.e. invite me to your parties). Everything starts to have new meaning and context.I&rsquo;m going to start tracking the new things that I learn, and the paths they lead down. Starting with some definitions of things I come across:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What is MongoDB?
MongoDB is an open source document-oriented system developed and supported by 10gen. It&rsquo;s part of the NoSQL movement. As opposed to SQL, a relational databses, it structures data in JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas called BSONs. This can make MongoDB faster than SQL. At the same time, most people who use MongoDB used SQL for many years first, which I think is important to note. MTV, Craigslist, and Foursquare use MongoDB.</p></li>
<li><p>What is Mongoid?
Mongoid is an Object-Document-Mapper (ODM) for MongoDB, written in Ruby. It provides a familiar API to Ruby developers who have been using Active Record or Data Mapper, while leveraging MongoDB&rsquo;s schemaless document-based design, dynamic queries, and atomic modifier operations. (NOTE TO SELF: figure out what are atomic modifier operations)</p></li>
</ol>


<p>What is JSON?
JSON is JavaScript Object Notation. It&rsquo;s a text-based open standard for human-readable data interchange, built on a collection of key-value pairs and arrays.  It comes from JavaScript objects, which represent simple data structures and associative arrays. Interestingly, though it references JavaScript, it is language-independent.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What is Active Record?
Active Record is a way to query databases in a SQL-like way in Rails without actually having to write SQL. It&rsquo;s compatible with MySWL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and others.</p></li>
<li><p>DataMapper:
DataMapper is an Object-Relational-Mapper (ORM) for Ruby. It&rsquo;s  fast, thread-safe and feature rich. It differentiates itself by having one API for a variety of datastores, the ability to develop a data-store independently of models using Migrations (NOTE: figure out what this means), and helpful when querying or supporting data-stores you don&rsquo;t manage yourself, such as legacy databases.</p></li>
</ol>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today marks the first day of my third week as a developer. This weekend was very transformative for me in terms of my growth and learning as a programmer. Thursday night I dreamed about code. Friday night marked the first gathering of the Flatiron School Drinking Club. I also learned how to DJ from my teacher at Fridays After Flatiron &ndash; learning to learn and all! These past two weeks, I&rsquo;ve been so inspired to learn new things or re-learn things I used to know. Every day presents a new idea &ndash; Relearn Japanese! Start DJing! Make a film! Run really far for a long time! Origami cranes! Tomorrow we&rsquo;re learning how to tie knots. Saturday I studied with classmates and learned from one how to play a Scandinavian version of bocci ball called Kubb. Sunday I rewrote code over and over again until the sounds got in my head. Today I really noticed today how much more fluent I was in Ruby syntax than last week. Then I saw Sacha Greif&rsquo;s &ldquo;Side Projects&rdquo; presentation on SpeakerDeck.</p>

<p>Greif makes awesome side projects. His presentation presents an argument for how and why.</p>

<p>Why should you work on side projects?</p>

<p>1) Build a product &ndash; learn how to bring an idea to execution and how to market it. Be your own CEO.
2) Learn something new &ndash; try out a cool new tool or framework
3) Get your name out there &ndash; can reach a lot of people &ndash; perhaps more than your regular work can</p>

<p>What makes a good side project?</p>

<p>1) Simple &ndash; be able to launch it in under 10 hours
2) Specific &ndash; solving well-defined need for specific target helps keep scope manageable &ndash; which is good practice in life in general
3) Special &ndash; have fun! stand out!</p>

<p>Find time</p>

<p>1) Scale down &ndash; if you can&rsquo;t increase time, decrease scope
2) Compromise &ndash; sacrifice some exercise, lunch, or sleep for one week to find those ten hours
3) Repurpose &ndash; take something you&rsquo;re doing anyway and make it your project</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t overthink, overcomplexify, tell a story</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m so inspired by these mantras and I think that practicing good habits in small doses can reflect in positive ways on larger challenges and problem-solving activities I engage in on a daily basis. When I do Bikram yoga for an hour and a half, it&rsquo;s easier for me to run for 45 minutes. When I&rsquo;m hot in Bikram, I think about how hot it was to run in India. This goes on. Take your challenges and make them into tools. Build up habits in one field to another. Perhaps this is why this high-growth, high-learning last two weeks have inspired me to learn so many other things, and why so many of my learning and growth experiences have emerging as I problem solve in code. Writing code over and over again reminds me of writing poems I like over and over again to get the rhythm in my head.</p>

<p>I think of one of my favorite lines (though I have a lot of favorite lines):</p>

<p>More than once I’ve felt like a small bug with the brain of a man, standing on a leaf floating through the blood vessels and veins in my own body. As I navigate through a leg or into a body cavity, I can clearly see the faults and the strengths of my current convictions – little vignettes in continuous action, like the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland, a haunted house carved into my organs and muscles. Anyhow, every day of my life when I draw another picture, I think maybe I’m trying to find something inside me that needs a new script. Like crashing your motorcycle and waking up and wondering why your foot is over there in the gutter. As I get older, I regret the mistakes of my life even deeper. And I feel the following things even more: Hooray for Happiness! Hooray for Life! Hooray for Everything!
-Mark Mothersbaugh</p>

<p>And another:</p>

<p>‘If you opened people up, you would find landscapes; if you opened me up, you would find beaches. Many old people wish to tell their life. As an old filmmaker, with the enthusiasm and energy of my youth, I tried to find a style and a form to tell my memories, my encounters, the ups and downs of my life. I shot my film as a kaleidoscope, a collage, a fantasy.’ Agnès Varda</p>

<p>My motto:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It loved to happen&rdquo; -Marcus Aurelius</p>

<p>This week:
10 hours, 1 side project. I think it&rsquo;s going to be about Citibike. I just cloned so many Citibike repos&hellip; and perhaps it will inspire me to learn how to ride a bike. Practice being a beginner&hellip;</p>

<p>More to come.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I called my blog &ldquo;Code as Collage&rdquo; for several reasons. First of all, collage has always been an important framework for me to think about how to put different disparate pieces together in a way that is insightful. I&rsquo;ve always kept notebooks, carried scissors and glue, and cut and collected things from different places. It&rsquo;s both a creative exercise and a way of thinking. Balanced between thinking and doing, integrating diverse pieces, moving things around until they are right, being comfortable in uncertainty while driving towards a goal &ndash; all of these remind me of the process of writing code, in terms of the repositories and creative work of others you draw from, putting together those different fragments in different ways to get at what you are trying to create, and trying to understand how those pieces can connect in the right way until you eventually get the program you are seeking. Not only that, but I think the process of collage is similar to the process of learning to code, at least for me. I&rsquo;m drawing upon and referencing a huge range of different experiences in my life as pieces to move around, take apart, and put together, as I start to learn how to be creative in a new way.</p>

<p>More thoughts on this to come.</p>

    <id>http://ruthienachmany.github.io/blog/2013/06/05/hello</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello! I&rsquo;m Ruthie and this is my first Octopress-powered blogging framework for hackers blog ever! I&rsquo;ve had blogs since I was in 7th grade (Xanga and Livejournal reprsent!), and most recently kept up  an active one (on Tumblr) when I was doing ethnographic fieldwork in the Maldives. Naturally, I was incredibly excited to start blogging again as a full-stack web development student at the Flatiron School, learning Ruby, Rails, SQL, Javascript, HTML, CSS and more over 12 weeks in summer 2013.</p>

<p>A little bit about me &ndash;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m originally from New York City, though my parents are from Israel and I&rsquo;m a dual citizen of the U.S./Israel. I think this shaped me in a way relevant to coding, in the sense that I grew up very agile in terms of locating between a few different fields and quickly shifting between them (something that&rsquo;s proven very helpful in terms of problem solving), and very comfortable in ambiguity, uncertainty, and abstraction as a result. I used to write a lot of poetry, and I remember struggling to accurately express personal meanings between relationships of ideas and words, given the intersections of meaning between certain words in one language that sound like words in another, etc. As a result, I&rsquo;m very interested in language, the spaces between a creator and a person who interacts with their creation, and the creative work that happens in that gap.</p>

<p>I thought a lot about those questions when I was a student at Princeton from 2008-12. Whenever I struggle in one field, I always find it helpful to apply learnings from another, and I think when I am in between a few different ways of thinking and drawing frameworks from one into another is probably one of my most creative, productive, and effective &lsquo;states&rsquo;. I sought to understand the ways that people attach personal meanings to objects, ideas, spaces, products, and services, across a range of fields, from my major in Anthropology, to my certificates in Film/Video Production and Environmental Studies, to international relations, politics, history, narrative, game theory, art history, prose poetry, etc.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m very interested in how people engage with information that challenges them, and have had the opportunity to explore that question across a range of areas, from developing ways for students to engage more deeply with the Princeton University Art Museum on campus or with community leaders across the United States via civic engagement break trips; to my junior paper which looked at outsider narratives of the Buffalo Creek coal mining disaster in journalism, law, sociology, psychology, fiction, and documentary; to my senior thesis on climate change in the Maldives; to my internships at the International Water Management Institute in India, where I conducted a consulting project, interviewing stakeholders and aggregating data to provide insights about how audiences engage with their scientific knowledge products and ways to develop those products to better align wth diverse needs, and at Climate Central, where I worked on a user-generated climate content platform for a new media journalism organization. In the past, I&rsquo;ve focused on art and environmental change/resource management as two areas that I think people are especially challenged to engage with, with significant global interconnections, but I&rsquo;m interested in this exploration as a broader framework.</p>

<p>At Princeton, I had the opportunity to make some films which were pretty significant to me. After I worked on water management in India in summer 2010, I traveled to Israel and created a film about collectors of protective Jewish jewelry (think talismans, amulets, etc). In some ways, it was an attempt to understand my grandfather better through the lens of the jewelry he collected and why he collected it. My mother grew up in Jerusalem and her family went to the market in the old city every weekend, so they collected a lot of different things, including this jewelry. Much of this jewelry is inscribed with different codes which represent anagrams of prayers (anagrams being more protective against the evil eye because of their codedness than putting out the full prayer). Go coding! For other pieces, the shape or color makes some reference that becomes protective. The jewelry has an interesting history. Both Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jews were big on amulets and superstition, but the Middle Eastern Jews were the ones who became the silversmiths in their communities and these amulets often became imbued into jewelry as a result. Anyways, in an attempt to understand what this jewelry means to my grandfather, I spoke to a number of other collectors, curators, creators etc of this jewelry, and eventually made a piece that explored their motivations as well as the relationship between my mother, my grandfather, and me. The summer after that, I took my learnings from that project, and explored the collaborative filmmaking process via a film about bellydancing in Fairbanks, Alaska. That was really interesting and I had the opportunity to connect to an inspiring community of women in Fairbanks. At the same time, I grew a bit disheartend with the idea of collaborative creation. Getting into coding and open-source now, I&rsquo;m getting re-inspired! I&rsquo;ve also done smaller projects and more experimental stuff, like performance art videos of myself that formed part of a multimedia exhibit that became my visual arts senior thesis at Princeton.</p>

<p>Another really important element of my time at Princeton was my senior thesis. I traveled to the Maldives in summer 2011 to explore the ways that people engage with climate change in a place often called &ldquo;the first country that will disappear due to sea level rise.&rdquo; When I arrived, I found a  community of young people becoming increasingly civically engaged with their country, which was under a dictatorship for 30 years until the revolution in 2008 which led to the first democratically elected president (and main proponent of making the narrative of climate change in the Maldives known around the world), President Mohamed Nasheed. A few months after my departure from the Maldives, in February 2012, there was a coup/change of power that led to Nasheed&rsquo;s Vice President Mohammed Hassan Waheed to become President. The process leading up to the coup and following its ocurrence was interesting in light of the tensions I observed coming to a head while I was in the country. What I didn&rsquo;t find in this community or elsewhere was much engagement with climate change, which was at first surprising &ndash; we think of climate change as a somewhat abstract thing in the future (though with all the environmental disasters that have occurred over the past year, perhaps this abstraction is changing), but in a country we imagine to be so immediately affected by climate change, we might expect a more visceral relationship. When I found that people didn&rsquo;t have much to say about climate change explicitly, I started speaking with members of this community, seeking advice on what they thought were interesting things for me to study that were happening in the country at the time. I realized that I was actually very interested in them as individuals and as a community, what drives and inspires and challenges them. I observed two major forces when I was in the Maldives &ndash; looking elsewhere to locate yourself, and imagining yourself and the country in other ways. I found myself starting to engage with these processes as well. These observations shed light on why Nasheed, who emerged from this community, chose the narrative of climate change as a way to make the Maldives known in the world, and these processes also shed light on the ways that this narrative is compelling to the climate change community in seeking to understand the abstractions of climate change.</p>

<p>These projects were really important to me, in the ways they helped me codify some of my approaches to independently structuring a project full of uncertainty, abstraction, moving global trends, and challenging concepts.</p>

<p>After graduating Princeton, I started working as a research analyst on the digital strategy team of an advertising agency, and eventually was promoted to a more client-facing role for a new pharmaceutical account. This was a great learning experience, and I&rsquo;m excited to draw my learnings from it in my next role. I left that role at the end of April, and starting Flatiron School at the beginning of June.</p>

<p>I have been drawing on the learnings from those experiences and others as I start to learn progamming. This course has been referencing so many different parts of my life and ways of thinking, and I&rsquo;m really excited to continue this exploration through summer 2013!</p>
